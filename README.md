# Horiseon website

This website was reworked on in the intent of restructuring the index and css aspect to this internet website. I was able to see that one of the headers named "Search Engine Optimization" was not redirecting me to the portion of the page titled the same thing due to the css portion not displaying the proper h2 code like it needed to be. When I cleaned that part up along with the index code I was able to see the website, index, and css code correctly.
